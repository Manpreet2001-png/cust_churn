#  E-Commerce Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

> Predicting customer churn in digital commerce with modern ML, responsible AI, and ethical modeling.

##  Overview

In today‚Äôs hyper-competitive e-commerce world, **predicting customer churn** is key to reducing revenue loss and improving customer loyalty. This project explores how machine learning can be used to identify which customers are likely to leave ‚Äî so companies can act before it's too late.

 Focus:
- Predictive analytics for e-commerce churn
- Real-time ML applications
- Ethical AI integration (GDPR, fairness, explainability)

---

##  Problem Statement

> ‚ÄúHow can we accurately and ethically predict customer churn in e-commerce, while ensuring fairness, interpretability, and scalability across various market conditions?‚Äù

This project aims to build ML pipelines that are not just **accurate**, but also **transparent**, **scalable**, and **legally compliant**.
